<h1>OSX Full Disk Access</h1>
<p>
Since the release of OSX 10.15 (Catalina) Apple has placed restrictions on disk access 
for apps installed from outside the app store.  This means that default installations of
SeqMonk will only be able to read data which is in your home directory.  Data elsewhere
such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your desktop</li>
<li>External drives</li>
<li>Network drives</li>
</ul>

<p>
...are inaccessible to SeqMonk, and browsing to those locations will either fail, or will
show apparently empty folders.  If you're happy to just keep your data in your home 
directory then that's fine, but if you want to load or save data in other locations then
you'll need to follow the steps below to give SeqMonk access to your whole drive.
</p>

<h2>Adding Permissions</h2>

<p>
Adding read permission to your whole computer will require that you have administrator
privileges on your Mac.  You'll only need these to set up the permissions - after that 
you can continue to run SeqMonk as a normal user.
</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Move SeqMonk to your Applications folder</h3>
<p>
Additional permissions will only work if SeqMonk is installed in your main Applications
folder, so just the Finder to drag SeqMonk to /Applications if it isn't there already.
</p>

<h3>Step 2 - Open your security preferences</h3>
<p>
From the main apple menu select System Preferences > Security &amp; Privacy and then from 
the list on the left select 'Full Disk Access'.
</p>
<p>
If the little padlock icon on the bottom left of the dialog is locked then click on it and
enter the username / password for an admin account to allow yourself to make changes.
</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Add SeqMonk to the list of allowed applications</h3>
<p>
Use the Finder to look at your Applications folder.  Select the SeqMonk application and 
drag it into the list on the right of the Full Disk Access preferences window (just above
the plus and minus buttons).  When you let go you should see the SeqMonk icon appear in the
list.

<p>
The next time you launch SeqMonk you should be able to access all areas of your disk.
</p>


<h2>Updating permissions after upgrading SeqMonk</h2>

<p>
You will find that after upgrading SeqMonk you may lose disk access permissions, even
though the SeqMonk icon still appears in the list of permitted applications.  If this
happens then select the SeqMonk entry in the list of Full Disk Access programs and then 
press the 'minus' icon just below the list to remove it.  Then re-add SeqMonk by dragging
it from the Applications folder, and disk access should be restored.

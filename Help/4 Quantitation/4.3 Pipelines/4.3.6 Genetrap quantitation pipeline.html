<h1>Genetrap quantitation pipeline</h1>

<p>
This pipeline is specialised for use in GeneTrap experiments.  It takes in 
a feature track of spliced features and does a read count quantitation.  The
unusual aspect of the pipeline is that it will only count a read against
a feature if either:

<ol>
<li>It overlaps with an exon of that feature, or</li>
<li>It sits within an intron, but in the same orientation as the feature</li>
</ol>

<h2>Options</h2>

<img src="genetrap_options.png" alt="RPKM Pipeline Options">
<p>The options you can set for this pipeline are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which type of feature you want to quantitate</li>

<li>Whether to generate raw counts, or have counts which are normalised by total count</li>

<li>Whether to log transform the counts</li>
</ol>

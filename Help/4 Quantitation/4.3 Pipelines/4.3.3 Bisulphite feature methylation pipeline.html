<h1>The Bisulphite feature methylation pipeline</h1>

<p>
The bisulphite feature methylation pipeline is a way to quantitate 
methylation over a whole feature but using only individual bases
whose methylation state is well observed.  It then calculates a 
pecentage methylation for each base and averages these to give an
overall value for the feature.
</p>
<p>
The pipeline assumes that you have methlyation data which uses the
standard convention of assigning methylated reads to the forward
strand and unmethylated reads to the reverse strand.  The reads should
generally only be 1bp in length.  This is the standard data you would
get from importing the output of the bismark methylation extractor via 
the text import option.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most other quantitation methods it's possible that this pipeline
won't assign a value to some probes in some datasets.  In these cases
the probe will be given the Not a Number (NaN) value, and will generally
be ignored in subsequent calulations and plots.

<h2>Options</h2>

<img src="bsseq_options.png" alt="BSSeq Pipeline Options">
<p>The options you can set for this pipeline are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which type of feature you want to quantitate (you can also opt
to use the current probe set if you've already made probes)</li>

<li>The minimum level of observation required to include a base in
the methylation calculation.  This is simply the depth of count over
that base. This value should be a fair reflection of the overall depth
of coverage in your data.  If you only have a 3X average coverage of
all bases then there's no point setting this value to 5 since you'll just
throw away all of your data.</li>

<li>The minimum level of observation for a feature - ie how many
individual bases need to have been called to make a call for the
feature as a whole.</li>

<li>How to combine the measures for a given feature.  You can choose
to report the mean, median, max or min value from the set of individual
base measures.</li>

</ol>

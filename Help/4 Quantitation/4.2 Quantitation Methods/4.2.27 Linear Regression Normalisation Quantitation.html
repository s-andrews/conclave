<h1>Linear Regression Normalisation Quantitation</h1>

<p>
This normalisation is useful where you have a linear change superimposed on
top of a normal set of quantitation differences.  It operates in a somewhat
similar way to the enrichment normalisation in that you define two percentiles
within your data around which you wish to base the normalisation.  In this
case though a line is drawn through these two percentiles and then the data
is re-scaled so that the line becomes flat, and fixed at a value of 0.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can choose the percentile values to set for the lower and upper reference
points.  You should look at the shape of the traces on the cumulative distriubution
plot to decide where you should sensibly set these.</li>
<li>You can choose which probe list to use to calculate the correction values</li>
</ol>

<h1>Enrichment Normalisation Quantitation</h1>

<p>
	Enrichment normalisation is useful in studies where you have a difference in
	enrichment efficiency between different samples.  It is related to the 
	percentile normalisation, where you specify a single reference percentile on
	which to normalise your data and the data is corrected by a single factor so
	that all samples have the same value at this reference point.
</p>
<p>
	In enrichment normalisation you specify two normalisation percentiles.  The
	lower percentile should represent the baseline value, and should be the 
	last part of your distribution you consider to be unenriched.  The second
	value should be the percentile at which you believe you have pretty much 
	saturated your enrichment.
</p>
<p>
	The way the enrichment normalisation works is that it applies a simple addition
	correction to get the different datasets to match exactly at the lower 
	percentile.  It then applies a multiplication correction so that the samples
	match at the upper percentile.  The data is therefore scaled between the two
	defined reference points, which should correct for any differences in 
	enrichment efficiency between samples.
</p>
<p>
	Enrichment normalisation would most commonly be used on ChIP-Seq samples where
	the efficiency of the ChIP may vary between different experiments.  It could
	also be used on other experiment types to try to even out other biases.  We
	have used it for example on looking at genomic coverage in PBAT bisulphite
	libraries where the data has an overall GC bias which is somewhat different
	in different samples.

<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can choose the percentile values to set for the lower and upper reference
points.  You should look at the shape of the traces on the cumulative distriubution
plot to decide where you should sensibly set these.</li>
<li>You can choose which probe list to use to calculate the correction values</li>
</ol>

<h1>The Even Coverage Probe Generator</h1>

<p>
The even coverage probe generator can be used to make tiled probes of varying sizes
such that the number of reads falling into each probe is the same.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p><img src="even_coverage_probe_generator.png" alt="Even Coverage Probe Generator Options"></p>
<p>The options you can set for this generator are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which data stores to use.  The reads from all selected stores will be merged
together and the combined count will be used to decide where to place the probe
boundaries.</li>

<li>Which strand of reads to use</li>

<li>Whether to ignore duplicated reads when performing the count</li>

<li>The target read count per probe.  The actual counts per window won't necessarily
be exactly this value due to boundary effects, but they should be fairly close</li>

<li>The maximum probe size - you can limit the maximum size of a probe to stop the 
creation of super long probes over (for example) centromeres etc.  If you set this 
value to 0 then no limit will be imposed</li>

</ol>

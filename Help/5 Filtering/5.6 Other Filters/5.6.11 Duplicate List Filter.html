<h1>Duplicate List Filter</h1>
<p>
This isn't really a filer as all it does is to take the selected probe list 
and make a new list containing the same probes as a sub-list of the current
one.
</p>
<p>
Its only real use is in helping you to artificially create some additional
structure in your set of probe lists to help organise things.

<h1>Segmentation Filter</h1>
<p>
The segmentation filter is useful in cases where you have an existing running quantitation
of your genome, but you can see spatially defined regions with consistently different 
quantitated values.  This could be something common such as looking for copy number 
variation in genomic data, or could be for blocks of enrichment in ChIP, or blocks of
methylation in BS-Seq.
</p>

<p>
The aim of the filter is to divide your existing probes into groups which follow a consistent
level of quantitation.  Furthermore, the blocks of probes can then be clustered to associate
blocks which have similar mean levels of quantitation.
</p>

<p>
The filter itself uses the fastseg BioConductor package to do the segmentation followed by
a custom grouping based on mean values.
</p>


<h2>Options</h2>
<ol>
<li>You must select a single data store whose data will be used to direct the segmentation</li>
<li>You can chose an &quot;alpha&quot; value - this is a value between 0 and 1 and 
determines the propensity of the algorithm to start a new segment. Lower values will tend to
produce larger segments, higher values will produce smaller segments.  No segment will contain
fewer than 4 probes, regardless of the alpha value</li>
<li>You can choose whether the segments are defined relative to a change to the previous 
quantitation (those to the left of the current position), or by setting the global option you
can add a constraint that they must also be different to the overall distribution of global values</li> 
<li>After the initial segmentation you will be shown a graph showing the mean quantitations for
the segments defined.  On this graph you can add, remove and move break points to say how you 
want the segments split into subgroups.  In addition to the overall list of segments (which will
always contain all probes, but with an annotated value to say which segment they fall into) you
will also get a probe list for each sub-group defined by the split points set in the second 
window.</li>


</ol>

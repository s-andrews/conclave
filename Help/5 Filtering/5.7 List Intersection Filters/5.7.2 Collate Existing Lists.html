<h1>Collate Existing Lists</h1>
<p>
The collate existing lists filter can be used to combine a number of different
probe lists where you want to select purely on the basis of how many of the lists
a given probe is in, and where it doesn't matter exactly which ones.
</p>

<p>
For example you can use the filter to find probes which are present in 4 out of
6 starting lists, or similar queries.  Things which would be a pain to do in 
a more pairwise comparison.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
The only options are that you select the lists you want to combine from the 
list on the left, and then you say how many of those lists must contain a
probe for it to be included.  The number can be stated as a minimum or 
maximum value.

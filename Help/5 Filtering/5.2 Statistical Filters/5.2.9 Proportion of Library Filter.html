<h1>Proportion of Library Filter</h1>
<p>
The proportion of library filter is a simplistic enrichment filter which 
uses a Chi-square test to examine whether the proportion of reads from
the whole library falling into a given probe has changed between two
data stores.
</p>
<p>
The test does not re-quantitate your data, but expects that your quantitations
will be raw uncorrected count values.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can choose the data stores you want to use for the test. At least 2
stores must be selected.</li>
<li>You can choose the significance threshold for the analysis</li>
<li>You can choose whether to apply multiple testing correction to your raw
p-values (you really should in nearly all cases)</li>
<li>You can choose to check only for enrichment, rather than enrichment or depletion</li>
</ul>

<h1>Vistories</h1>
<p>
Vistories are a way to document an analysis you perform within SeqMonk.  They
are a report type which allows you to mix the automatic recording of events
within the program (probe generation, filtering etc), with formatted text
and embedded results such as graphs and tables.  Vistories can be used to 
create a complete record of what you did in SeqMonk and then save it to an
HTML document which you can archive or distribute to share your analysis with
others.
</p>

<h2>Opening a Vistory</h2>
<p>A vistory is automatically created as soon as you start a project in SeqMonk
and will start collecting automated events.  To open up the report and start
adding content to it just click on the large "V" icon on the toolbar, or by
selecting Reports &gt; Show Vistory from the main menu.  You only
have one vistory associated with each SeqMonk session and you can close and open
the actual vistory window as often as you like without losing the content.
</p>

<h2>Adding content</h2>
<p>
A vistory is composed of a series of blocks.  Each block is of a specific type
of content.  The different kinds of content you can add to your vistory are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Summaries</li>
<li>Data Events</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Text Areas</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>Tables</li>
</ul>

Some of these (titles and text) can be added anywhere in the document, and can
be moved up and down at any point.  Most others are added at the end so they
always reflect the order in which the actions happened within the program.  

Any block can be deleted by pressing the red X on the right, but you should be 
aware that deleting data event blocks might mean that you have an incomplete 
record of your work.  Moveable blocks can be moved up and down the document by
pressing the up and down arrows on the right.

<h3>Project Summaries</h3>
<p>When you first start a project, or re-open an existing project you will see
a flurry of automated events as the various groups and replicate sets are created 
and the quantitation is defined.  This can look a little messy, so rather than keep
these as isolated events you can clear your vistory and insert a Project Summary.
This adds a set of tables which summarise the current state of your project and 
serves as a good starting point for most analyses.
</p>

<h3>Data Events</h3>
<p>Any action which modifies the data stored in your project will trigger the 
automatic insertion of a data event into your vistory.  Typical events would
be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Loading a new data set</li>
<li>Creating a new data group or replicate set</li>
<li>Creating a new probe set</li>
<li>Running a quantitation</li>
<li>Running a filter</li>
</ul>

<p>
These should collect enough information to allow you to replicate the actions
which you used during your analysis.
</p>

<h3>Titles and Text</h3>
<p>Text input in a vistory comes in two types, titles and text.  Titles can
be of two levels (title and subtitle) and all can be inserted by pressing the
appropriate buttons in the toolbar of the vistory.</p>
<p>
Since it's common to add text after the analysis you can insert a title or 
text block at any point.  You can select a block in a vistory by clicking on
it and you should see a grey box appear around it.  When you insert a title
or text block it will insert below the selected block.
</p>
<p>
Title and text blocks can be moved after insertion.  Just press the blue up
or down arrows on the right of the block to move their position.</p>
<p>
As well as showing a title and subtitle in your document, the titles and
subtitles will also be used to build a navigation table of contents in your
compiled document so it's a good idea to use these to structure your work</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>
Within SeqMonk every graphical window which opens has the option to save the
graphic.  When you choose this you will be given the choice of whether to save
it to a file, or to embedd it into your vistory.  Graphics inserted into the 
vistory will appear exactly the same as when they were in the main program so
it effectively takes a screen shot.</p>

<p>
If the inserted graphic is too big to fit into the vistory window you can see
the rest of it by clicking and dragging on the graphic to scroll it across the
page.  When exported into an HTML document large graphics will have scroll bars
added to them.
</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>
Any table which can be saved (normally reports) can also now be embedded into
a vistory.  The table will appear directly in the report and will retain the 
ordering at the point where it was inserted.
</p>

<h2>Saving Vistories</h2>
<p>
Vistories are NOT saved along with the main SeqMonk project - they have their
own files, and they can be loaded and saved independently of the main project.
</p>
<p>
You can save your vistory using the Save or SaveAs options in the vistory
toolbar.  You can also load in a previously saved vistory and this can either
replace your current vistory, or be appended to the end of it.
</p>

<h2>Exporting to HTML</h2>
<p>You can create HTML reports from your vistory.  These will be nicely formatted
documents which you can read in a web browser.  They contain all of the information
in your vistory including all graphics and table data.  Graphics are embedded 
into the HTML document so you can distribute just a single file.  HTML documents
can't be re-loaded into a vistory, so you should also use the save option to 
keep your analysis in an editable form.</p>

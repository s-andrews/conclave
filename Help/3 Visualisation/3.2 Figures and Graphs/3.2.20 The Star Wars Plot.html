<h1>The Star Wars Plot</h1>

<p>
The Star Wars plot provides a very simple summary of a number of
different data stores and probe sets.  For each store it shows
the mean quantitation represented by a filled circle and a 
confidence interval (Standard Error) represented by whiskers.
</p>

<p>
To create a Star Wars plot select Plots &gt; Star Wars Plot
from the main menu.  You can then choose whether you want the plot
to show all visible data stores for the currently active probe list
or whether you want to select a set of probe lists to plot for the
currently active data store. The plot window will appear immediately and
the individual plots will appear as they are calculated.  This 
may take a few seconds for larger data sets.
</p>

<p>
Where multiple plots are drawn they will all be placed onto the same
scale so you can quickly compare between them.
</p>

<p>
Within the Star Wars plot menu you can choose to plot either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One probe list against the currently visible set of DataStores</li>
<li>The currently active data store against a selected set of probe lists</li>
<li>A set of probe lists against the currently visible data stores (in this case
you can choose within the plot if the data stores or the probe lists go on
the x-axis)</li>

<h1>The Strand Bias Plot</h1>

<p>
The strand bias plot allows you to look at the directionality of the reads
underneath a set of probes. It produces a 2D plot showing the proportion 
of reads on the reference strand on the y-axis against the number of reads
on the x-axis

<p>
The reference strand is the forward strand, unless your probes have a direction
associated with them, in which case it will be the direction of the probe.

<h1>The PCA Plot</h1>

<p>
The PCA plot is a simple graphical way to look at the overall relatedness
of a number of data stores.  It picks out the strongest signals in the
current quantitation and separates them into Principal Components (PCs) - 
weighted sets of probes which best separate your data.  You can then
pick pairs of PCs to plot against each other to see the grouping of your
data stores.

In addition to the main scatterplot you also get a second plot window 
which shows for each PC the degree of the overall variance in the set
of data stores which is explained by each PC to see how much information
it is likely to contain.  This second window also shows you the distribution
of rotations applied to your probes within this PC.  A slider at the bottom
of the window allows you to select a cutoff within these rotations and to
create a probe list from the probes with more extreme rotations, so that you
can look at these to see which probes are the main drivers for this PC.

The PCA plot will work on whichever data stores are currently displayed
in the chromosome view.

With the scatterplot of the PCA plot you can put your mouse over any individual
point which will then cause the name of that point to be drawn under it so you
can tell which point is which.  You can also tick the labels box to see all sample
labels (though this might get a bit messy). There is also an option to highlight any 
replicate sets you've made in the project so you can see if groups of data stores
which you would expect to cluster together actually behave that way in your data.

<h1>The Bean Plot</h1>

<p>
The Bean Plot is a view designed to let you compare the
distribution of probe values across several data stores, or
several probe lists across a single data store.
</p>

<p>
A bean plot is a more complete way to represent a distribution than
more summarised plots such as a box whisker plot.  It shows the 
smoothed density of points over a window called the 'bandwidth' so
you can more easily represent more complex distributions accurately.
</p>

<p>
In SeqMonk the bandwidth used is 5% of the total range of the 
quantitation displayed in the plot.
</p>

<p>
To create a Bean plot select Plots &gt; Bean Plot
from the main menu.  You can then choose whether you want the plot
to show all visible data stores for the currently active probe list
or whether you want to select a set of probe lists to plot for the
currently active data store. The plot window will appear immediately and
the individual plots will appear as they are calculated.  This 
may take a few seconds for larger data sets.
</p>

<p>
Where multiple plots are drawn they will all be placed onto the same
scale so you can quickly compare between them.
</p>
<p>
Within the Bean plot menu you can choose to plot either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One probe list against the currently visible set of DataStores</li>
<li>The currently active data store against a selected set of probe lists</li>
<li>A set of probe lists against the currently visible data stores (in this case
you can choose within the plot if the data stores or the probe lists go on
the x-axis)</li>
